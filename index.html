    <h2>ðŸ“Œ About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an academic researcher and currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Informatics & Telecommunications of the University of Ioannina, where I also completed both my Bachelor and Master studies. Alongside my research, I work as a private tutor in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I have several years of professional experience as a Computer Engineer, IT specialist, and Network consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always been passionate about technology. From a young age, I was involved with anything related to computers and electronics. This passion has shaped my professional and academic path and defines my creative and committed personality. I approach every project with dedication and always strive to achieve the goals I set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of academics, I enjoy cycling around the city of Ioannina as part of local cycling groups. I also voluntarily provide computer and network solutions to people in need, combining my technical skills with a desire to give back to the community.
